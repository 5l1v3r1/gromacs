\subsection{ Electrostatics and VdW}
\begin{description}
\item[{\bf coulombtype:}]\mbox{}\\
\vspace{-2ex}\begin{description}
\item[{\bf Cut-off}]\mbox{}\\
Twin range cut-off's with neighborlist cut-off {\bf rlist} and 
Coulomb cut-off {\bf rcoulomb},
where {\bf rlist} {\tt $<$} {\bf rvdw} {\tt $<$} {\bf rcoulomb}.
The dielectric constant is set with {\bf epsilon\_r}.
\item[{\bf PPPM}]\mbox{}\\
Particle-Particle Particle-Mesh algorithm for long range
electrostatic interactions.
Use for example {\bf rlist}{\tt =1.0}, {\bf rcoulomb\_switch}{\tt =0.0},
{\bf rcoulomb}{\tt =0.85}, {\bf rvdw\_switch}{\tt =1.0}
and {\bf rvdw}{\tt =1.0}. The grid
dimensions are controlled by {\bf fourierspacing}.
Reasonable grid spacing for PPPM is 0.05-0.1 nm.
See {\tt Shift} for the details of the particle-particle potential.
NOTE: Pressure scaling is not possible with PPPM.
\item[{\bf Ewald}]\mbox{}\\
Classical Ewald sum electrostatics. Use e.g. {\bf rlist}=0.9,
{\bf rvdw}=0.9, {\bf rcoulomb}=0.9. The highest magnitude of
wavevectors used in reciprocal space is controlled by
{\bf fourier\_nx}, {\bf fourier\_ny}, {\bf fourier\_nz}. Reasonable
values are about 2 for each nm of box size. The relative accuracy of direct/reciprocal space
is controlled by {\bf ewald\_rtol}. NOTE: Ewald scales as O(N$^{3/2}$) and
is thus extremely slow for large systems. It is included mainly for
reference - in most cases PME will perform much better.
\item[{\bf PME} ]\mbox{}\\
Fast Particle-Mesh Ewald electrostatics. Direct space is similar
to the Ewald sum, while the reciprocal part is performed with
FFTs. Grid dimensions are controlled as for PPPM, and the
interpolation order with {\bf pme\_order}. With a grid spacing of 0.1
nm and (cubic interpolation) the electrostatic forces have an accuracy
of 2-3e-4. Since the error from the vdw-cutoff is larger than this you
might try 0.15 nm. When running in parallel the interpolation
parallelizes better than the FFT, so try decreasing grid dimensions
while increasing interpolation.
\item[{\bf Reaction-Field}]\mbox{}\\
Reaction field with Coulomb cut-off {\bf rcoulomb},
where {\bf rcoulomb} {\tt $>$} {\bf rvdw} {\tt $>$} {\bf rlist}.
The dielectric constant beyond the cut-off is {\bf epsilon\_r}.
The dielectric constant can be set to infinity by setting {\bf epsilon\_r}=0.
\item[{\bf Generalized-Reaction-Field}]\mbox{}\\
Generalized reaction field with Coulomb cut-off {\bf rcoulomb},
where {\bf rcoulomb} {\tt $>$} {\bf rvdw} {\tt $>$} {\bf rlist}.
The dielectric constant beyond the cut-off is {\bf epsilon\_r}.
The ionic strength is computed from the number of charged 
(i.e. with non zero charge) charge groups.
The temperature for the GRF potential is set with 
{\bf ref\_t} [K].
\item[{\bf Shift}]\mbox{}\\
The Coulomb
potential is decreased over the whole range and the forces decay smoothly
to zero between {\bf rcoulomb\_switch} and {\bf rcoulomb}.
The neighborsearch cut-off {\bf rlist} should be 0.1 to 0.3 nm larger than
{\bf rcoulomb} to accommodate for the size of charge groups and diffusion
between neighborlist updates.
\item[{\bf User}]\mbox{}\\
Specify {\bf rshort} and {\bf rlong} to the same value, {\tt mdrun}
will now expect to find a file {\tt ctab.xvg} with user-defined functions.
This files should contain 5 columns:
the {\tt x} value, and the function value with its 1$^{st}$
to 3$^{rd}$ derivative. The {\tt x} should run from 0 [nm] to
{\bf rlist}{\tt +0.5} [nm], with a spacing of {\tt 0.002}
[nm] when you run in single precision, or {\tt 0.0005} [nm] when
you run in double precision. The function value at {\tt x=0} is not
important.

\item[{\bf Shift}]\mbox{}\\
The LJ (not Buckingham)
potential is decreased over the whole range and the forces decay smoothly
to zero between {\bf rvdw\_switch} and {\bf rvdw}.
The neighborsearch cut-off {\bf rlist} should be 0.1 to 0.3 nm larger than
{\bf rvdw} to accommodate for the size of charge groups and diffusion
between neighborlist updates.
\item[{\bf User}]\mbox{}\\
{\tt mdrun} will now expect to find two files with user-defined
functions: {\tt rtab.xvg} for Repulsion, {\tt dtab.xvg} for Dispersion.
These files should contain 5 columns:
the {\tt x} value, and the function value with its 1$^{st}$
to 3$^{rd}$ derivative. The {\tt x} should run from 0 [nm] to
{\bf rvdw}{\tt +0.5} [nm], with a spacing of {\tt 0.002}
[nm] when you run in single precision, or {\tt 0.0005} [nm] when
you run in double precision. The function value at {\tt x=0} is not
important. When you want to use LJ correction, make sure that {\bf rvdw}
corresponds to the cut-off in the user-defined function.

2, 3, 5 and 7. Avoid large primes.
\item[{\bf pme\_order }(4)]\mbox{}\\
Interpolation order for PME. 4 equals cubic interpolation. You might try
6/8/10 when running in parallel and simultaneously decrease grid dimension.
\item[{\bf ewald\_rtol }(1e-5)]\mbox{}\\
The relative strength of the Ewald-shifted direct potential at the cutoff
is given by {\bf ewald\_rtol}. Decreasing this will give a more accurate
direct sum, but then you need more wavevectors for the reciprocal sum.
\item[{\bf optimize\_fft:}]\mbox{}\\

\item[{\bf no}]\mbox{}\\
Don't calculate the optimal FFT plan for the grid at startup.

Beware that isotropic scaling can lead to extreme deformation
of the simulation box.

Surface tension couling for surfaces parallel to the xy-plane.
Uses normal pressure coupling for the z-direction, while the surface tension
is coupled to the x/y dimensions of the box.
The first {\bf ref\_p} value is the reference surface tension times
the number of surfaces [bar nm], 
the second value is the reference z-pressure [bar].
The two {\bf compressibility} [bar$^{-1}$] values are the compressibility
in the x/y and z direction respectively.
The value for the z-compressibility should be reasonably accurate since it
influences the converge of the surface-tension, it can also be set to zero
to have a box with constant height.

will not go below 0 [K], i.e. after {\bf zero\_temp\_time} (if it is positive) 
the reference temperature will be 0 [K]. Negative {\bf zero\_temp\_time} 
results in heating, which will go on indefenitely.

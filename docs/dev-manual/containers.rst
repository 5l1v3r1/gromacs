Containers
==========

|Gromacs| project infrastructure uses Docker containerization to
isolate automated tasks.
A number of images are maintained to provide a breadth of testing coverage.

Scripts and configuration files for building images are stored in the repository
under :file:`admin/containers/`
Images are (re)built manually by |Gromacs| project staff and pushed to
repositories at https://hub.docker.com/u/gromacs

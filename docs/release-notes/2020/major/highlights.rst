Highlights
^^^^^^^^^^

|Gromacs| NEXT was released on INSERT DATE HERE. Patch releases may
have been made since then, please use the updated versions!  Here are
some highlights of what you can expect, along with more detail in the
links below!

As always, we've got several useful performance improvements, with or
without GPUs, all enabled and automated by default. We are extremely
interested in your feedback on how well this worked on your
simulations and hardware. They are:

* Density-guided simulations allow "fitting" atoms into three-dimensional
  density maps. 
* Inclusion of gmxapi 0.1, an API and user interface for managing
  complex simulations, data flow, and pluggable molecular dynamics extension code.


.. Note to developers!
   Please use """"""" to underline the individual entries for fixed issues in the subfolders,
   otherwise the formatting on the webpage is messed up.
   Also, please use the syntax :issue:`number` to reference issues on redmine, without the
   a space between the colon and number!

is granted to ....................................

in exchange for the following commitments:

I hereby certify that


	(1) I will not use the software in commercial activities without
	    a written commercial license agreement; commercial activities
	    include, in particular, work under contract from a commercial
	    company.

	(2) I will not redistribute the software to others outside of my
	    immediate research group. I will suggest to other interested
	    research groups to contact the authors directly. When I leave 
            my current institution, I will either delete the software or
            reapply for a new license.

	(3) I will not alter or suppress the run-time copyright message.

	(4) I will acknowledge the program authors on any publication of
	    scientific results based in part on use of the program and 
	    cite the article in which the program was described.

	(5) I will report evidence of program bugs to the authors.

	(7) I will send the source code of any bug corrections and program
	    extensions, major or minor, to the original authors, for free
	    academic use. If I have made major extensions which are incor-
	    porated by the authors, I reserve the right to be appropriately
	    included in any future commercial license agreement.

	(8) I will not extract part of the software, e.g. modules or sub-
            routines, for use in other contexts without permission by the
	    authors.

	(9) I will not use the software in the context of classified research.

	(10) I am authorized to act on behalf of my employer.
	     Item (10) does not apply if this agreement is co-signed by
	     a responsible official.

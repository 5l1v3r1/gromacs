.SH DESCRIPTION
g_cluster can cluster structures with several different methods.
Distances between structures can be determined from a trajectory
or read from an XPM matrix file with the 
.B -dm
option.
RMS deviation after fitting or RMS deviation of atom-pair distances
can be used to define the distance between structures.


full linkage: add a structure to a cluster when its distance to any
element of the cluster is less than 
.B cutoff
.


Jarvis Patrick: add a structure to a cluster when this structure
and a structure in the cluster have each other as neighbors and
they have a least 
.B P
neighbors in common. The neighbors
of a structure are the M closest structures or all structures within

.B cutoff
.


Monte Carlo: reorder the RMSD matrix using Monte Carlo.


diagonalization: diagonalize the RMSD matrix.

gromos: use algorithm as described in Daura 
.I et al.

(
.I Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.

.B 1999
, 
.I 38
, pp 236-240).
Count number of neighbors using cut-off, take structure with
largest number of neighbors with all its neighbors as cluster
and eleminate it from the pool of clusters. Repeat for remaining
structures in pool.


When the clustering algorithm assigns each structure to exactly one
cluster (full linkage, Jarvis Patrick and gromos) and a trajectory
file is supplied, the structure with
the smallest average distance to the others or the average structure
or all structures for each cluster will be written to a trajectory
file. When writing all structures, separate numbered files are made
for each cluster.

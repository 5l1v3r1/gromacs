.SH DESCRIPTION
g_polystat plots static properties of polymers as a function of time
and prints the average.


By default it determines the average end-to-end distance and radii
of gyration of polymers. It asks for an index group and split this
into molecules. The end-to-end distance is then determined using
the first and the last atom in the index group for each molecules.
For the radius of gyration the total and the three principal components
for the average gyration tensor are written.
With option 
.B -v
the eigenvectors are written.
With option 
.B -pc
also the average eigenvalues of the individual
gyration tensors are written.


With option 
.B -p
the presistence length is determined.
The chosen index group should consist of atoms that are
consecutively bonded in the polymer mainchains.
The presistence length is then determined from the cosine of
the angles between bonds with an index difference that is even,
the odd pairs are not used, because straight polymer backbones
are usually all trans and therefore only every second bond aligns.
The persistence length is defined as number of bonds where
the average cos reaches a value of 1/e. This point is determined
by a linear interpolation of log(cos).

.SH DESCRIPTION
tpbconv can edit run input files in four ways.


.B 1st.
by modifying the number of steps in a run input file
with option 
.B -nsteps
or option 
.B -runtime
.



.B 2st.
(OBSOLETE) by creating a run input file
for a continuation run when your simulation has crashed due to e.g.
a full disk, or by making a continuation run input file.
This option is obsolete, since mdrun now writes and reads
checkpoint files.
Note that a frame with coordinates and velocities is needed.
When pressure and/or Nose-Hoover temperature coupling is used
an energy file can be supplied to get an exact continuation
of the original run.



.B 3nd.
by creating a tpx file for a subset of your original
tpx file, which is useful when you want to remove the solvent from
your tpx file, or when you want to make e.g. a pure Ca tpx file.

.B WARNING: this tpx file is not fully functional
.

.B 4rd.
by setting the charges of a specified group
to zero. This is useful when doing free energy estimates
using the LIE (Linear Interaction Energy) method.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "-[no]h"  "no    "
 Print help info and quit

.BI "-nice"  " int" " 0" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "-nsteps"  " int" " -1" 
 Change the number of steps

.BI "-runtime"  " real" " -1    " 
 Set the run time (ps)

.BI "-time"  " real" " -1    " 
 Continue from frame at this time (ps) instead of the last frame

.BI "-extend"  " real" " 0     " 
 Extend runtime by this amount (ps)

.BI "-until"  " real" " 0     " 
 Extend runtime until this ending time (ps)

.BI "-[no]zeroq"  "no    "
 Set the charges of a group (from the index) to zero

.BI "-[no]cont"  "yes   "
 For exact continuation, the constraints should not be solved before the first step

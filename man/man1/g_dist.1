.SH DESCRIPTION
g_dist can calculate the distance between the centers of mass of two
groups of atoms as a function of time. The total distance and its
x, y and z components are plotted.


Or when 
.B -dist
is set, print all the atoms in group 2 that are
closer than a certain distance to the center of mass of group 1.


With options 
.B -lt
and 
.B -dist
the number of contacts
of all atoms in group 2 that are closer than a certain distance
to the center of mass of group 1 are plotted as a function of the time
that the contact was continously present.


Other programs that calculate distances are 
.B g_mindist

and 
.B g_bond
.

.SH DESCRIPTION
g_energy extracts energy components or distance restraint
data from an energy file. The user is prompted to interactively
select the energy terms she wants.


When the 
.B -viol
option is set, the time averaged
violations are plotted and the running time-averaged and
instantaneous sum of violations are recalculated. Additionally
running time-averaged and instantaneous distances between
selected pairs can be plotted with the 
.B -pairs
option.


Average and RMSD are calculated with full precision from the
simulation (see printed manual). Drift is calculated by performing
a LSQ fit of the data to a straight line. Total drift is drift
multiplied by total time.


With 
.B -fee
a free energy estimate is calculated using
the formula: G = -ln  e  (E/kT)  * kT, where k is Boltzmann's
constant, T is set by 
.B -fetemp
and the average is over the
ensemble (or time in a trajectory). Note that this is in principle
only correct when averaging over the whole (Boltzmann) ensemble
and using the potential energy. This also allows for an entropy
estimate using G = H - T S, where H is the enthalpy (H = U + p V)
and S entropy.


When a second energy file is specified (
.B -f2
), a free energy
difference is calculated dF = -kT ln  e  -(EB-EA)/kT A ,
where EA and EB are the energies from the first and second energy
files, and the average is over the ensemble A. 
.B NOTE
that
the energies must both be calculated from the same trajectory.

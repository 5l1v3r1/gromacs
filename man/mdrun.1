.SH DESCRIPTION
The mdrun program performs Molecular Dynamics simulations.
It reads the run input file (
.B -s
) and distributes the
topology over nodes if needed. The coordinates are passed
around, so that computations can begin.
First a neighborlist is made, then the forces are computed.
The forces are globally summed, and the velocities and
positions are updated. If necessary shake is performed to constrain
bond lengths and/or bond angles.
Temperature and Pressure can be controlled using weak coupling to a
bath.


mdrun produces at least three output file, plus one log file
(
.B -g
) per node.
The trajectory file (
.B -o
), contains coordinates, velocities and
optionally forces.
The structure file (
.B -c
) contains the coordinates and
velocities of the last step.
The energy file (
.B -e
) contains energies, the temperature,
pressure, etc, a lot of these things are also printed in the log file
of node 0.
Optionally coordinates can be written to a compressed trajectory file
(
.B -x
).


When running in parallel with PVM or an old version of MPI the

.B -np
option must be given to indicate the number of
nodes.


The option 
.B -dgdl
is only used when free energy perturbation is
turned on.


With 
.B -rerun
an input trajectory can be given for which 
forces and energies will be (re)calculated. Neighbor searching will be
performed for every frame, unless 
.B nstlist
is zero
(see the 
.B .mdp
file).


ED (essential dynamics) sampling is switched on by using the 
.B -ei

flag followed by an 
.B .edi
file.
The 
.B .edi
file can be produced using options in the essdyn
menu of the WHAT IF program. mdrun produces a 
.B .edo
file that
contains projections of positions, velocities and forces onto selected
eigenvectors.


The -table option can be used to pass mdrun a formatted table with
user-defined potential functions. The file is read from either the
current directory or from the GMXLIB directory. A number of preformatted
tables are presented in the GMXLIB dir, for 6-8, 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 6-12
Lennard Jones potentials with normal Coulomb.


The options 
.B -pi
, 
.B -po
, 
.B -pd
, 
.B -pn
are used
for potential of mean force calculations and umbrella sampling.
See manual.


When mdrun receives a TERM signal, it will set nsteps to the current
step plus one. When mdrun receives a USR1 signal, it will set nsteps
to the next multiple of nstxout after the current step.
In both cases all the usual output will be written to file.
When running with MPI, a signal to one of the mdrun processes
is sufficient, this signal should not be sent to mpirun or
the mdrun process that is the parent of the others.

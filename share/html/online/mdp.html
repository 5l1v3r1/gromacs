<P> <a href="mdp_opt.html">full description of the options</a>.  </P>

<P> Here is a sample mdp file.
The ordering of the items is not important, but if you enter the same
thing twice, the <b>first</b> is used. Dashes and underscores on the 
left hand side are ignored.</P>

<P> The values of the options are reasonable values for a 1 nanosecond
MD run of a protein in a box of water. </P>

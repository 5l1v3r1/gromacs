<a name="start"><H1>Getting started.</A></H1>

In this chapter we assume the reader is familiar with Molecular
Dynamics and familiar with Unix, including the use of a text editor
such as <tt>emacs</tt> or <tt>vi</tt>. We furthermore assume the
software is installed properly on your system. When you see a line
like
<P><TT>
% ls -l 
</TT></P>
you are supposed to type the contents of that line (not the
<TT>%</TT>) on your computer.

<P>We will also assume that you know where your version of GROMACS is
installed. For local users in the Groningen MD group that is simply
'~gmx', e.g. the GMXRC is located in ~gmx/GMXRC. For other users that 
is probably not the case, contact your local system administrator for
more information. The directories named in this section are valid for the 
Groningen MD group.

<P><H2><A NAME="setup">Setting up your environment</A></H2>

Edit your <TT>.cshrc</TT> file to include the following statement:
<P><TT>
source ~gmx/GMXRC
</TT></P>
which has some (system dependent) PATH settings etcetera. Then type
<P><TT>
% source ~gmx/GMXRC
</TT></P>
to start right away, or, alternatively 
log off and on again to automatically source the environment.
<P>
Check if you now have the proper environment by
<P><TT>
% echo $GMXHOME
</TT></P>
It should read something like: 
<P><TT>
/home/gmx/gmx2.0
</TT></P>
This is the directory in which the binaries and
library files live. If you see nothing (a blank line) something is
wrong with the installation, check with your system manager, or (if
<EM>you</EM> are the system manager) you did something wrong 
somewhere <b>:(</b>

<P><H2><A NAME="examples">Examples.</A></H2>
Before starting the examples, you have to copy all the neccesary
files, to your own directory. Chdir to the directory you want to put
the examples directory. This directory (named <tt>tutor</tt>) 
will need
about 20 MB of disk space, when it is completely filled.
<P>
<TT>% cd </TT>``your own directory''
</P> 
then copy the examples: 
<P><TT>
% cp -r ~gmx/home1.6/tutor .
</TT></P> 
(NOTE: include the ``<TT>.</TT>'') You now have a subdirectory
<tt>tutor</tt>. Move there
<P><TT>
% cd tutor
</TT></P> 
and view the contents of this directory
<P><TT>
% ls -l
</TT></P> 
If all is well you will have five subdirectories with examples 
with names like <tt>gmxdemo</tt>, <tt>nmr1</tt>, <tt>nmr2</tt>, 
<tt>speptide</tt> and <tt>water</tt>.
<P>
You are encouraged to look up the different programs and
file formats in <a href="../online2.0.html">
the online manual</a> while you are browsing through the examples.</p>

<br><hr><br>

<P><H1><A NAME="demo">GMX demo.</A></H1>
The demo is designed to demonstrate the user-friendlyness
of the GROMACS software package. Start the demo by going
to your <tt>tutor/gmxdemo</tt> directory:
<P><TT>
% cd tutor/gmxdemo
</TT></P> Start the demo: 
<P><TT>
% demo
</TT></P>
This demo handles a complete Molecular Dynamics simulation of a
peptide in water, starting from a 
<a href="pdb.html">pdb</a> structure. When we start a
Molecular Dynamics simulation with GROMACS we need the following files.

<P><H3><A NAME="top">Molecular Topology file (<TT><a href="top.html">.top</a></TT>)</A></H3>
The molecular topology file is generated by the program <TT>
<a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a></TT>. <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> translates a <a href="pdb.html">pdb</a> structure file of any peptide
or protein
to a molecular topology file. This topology file contains a complete
description of all the interactions in your peptide or protein.
	
<P><H3><A NAME="gro">Molecular Structure file (<TT><a href="gro.html">.gro</a>, <a href="pdb.html">.pdb</a></TT>)</A></H3>
When the <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> program is executed to generate a molecular
topology, it also translates the structure file (<TT><a href="pdb.html">.pdb</a></TT> file) 
to a gromos
structure file (<TT><a href="gro.html">.gro</a></TT> file). The main difference between a 
<a href="pdb.html">pdb</a> file and a gromos file is their format and that
a <TT><a href="gro.html">.gro</a></TT> file can also hold velocities. However, if you do not need the
velocities, you can also use a <a href="pdb.html">pdb</a> file in most programs.
To generate a box of solvent molecules
around the peptide, the program 
<a href="genbox.html">genbox</a> is used. First the program
<a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> should be used to
define a box of appropriate size around the molecule.
<a href="genbox.html">genbox</a>
dissolves a solute molecule (the peptide) into any solvent (in this
case water). The output of <TT><a href="genbox.html">genbox</a></TT> is a gromos structure file of
the peptide dissolved in water. The <a href="genbox.html">genbox</a> program also changes the
molecular topology file (generated by <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a>) to add solvent
to the topology. 

<P><H3><A NAME="mdp">Molecular Dynamics parameter file (<TT><a href="mdp_opt.html">.mdp</a></TT>)</A></H3>
The Molecular Dynamics Parameter (<TT><a href="mdp_opt.html">.mdp</a></TT>) file contains all
information about the Molecular Dynamics simulation itself 
e.g. time-step, number of steps, temperature, pressure etc. The
easiest way of handling such a file is by adapting a sample <TT><a href="mdp_opt.html">mdp</a></TT>
file. A <TT><a href="mdp.html">sample mdp file</a></TT>
can be found online.

<P><H3><A NAME="ndx">Index file (<TT><a href="ndx.html">.ndx</a></TT>)</A></H3>
Sometimes you may need an index file to specify actions on groups of atoms
(e.g. Temperature coupling, accelerations, freezing). For this demo we will
not consider the use of index files however.

<P><H3><A NAME="tpb">Binary Topology file (<TT><a href="tpb.html">.tpb</a></TT>)</A></H3>
The next step is to combine the molecular structure (<TT><a href="gro.html">.gro</a></TT> file),
topology (<TT><a href="top.html">.top</a></TT> file) MD-parameters (<TT><a href="mdp_opt.html">.mdp</a> file</TT>) and 
(optionally) the
index file (<TT><a href="ndx.html">ndx</a></TT>) to generate a binary topology file (<TT><a href="tpb.html">.tpb</a>
extension</tt>). This file contains all information needed to start a
Simulation with GROMACS. 
The <a href="grompp.html">
grompp</a> program processes all input files and generates the binary 
topology <a href="tpb.html">tpb</a> file.

<P><H3><A NAME="trx">Trajectory file (<TT><a href="trj.html">.trj</a></TT>)</A></H3>

Once the binary topology is available, we can start the
simulation. The program which starts the simulation is called 
<a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a>. The only input file
of <TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> is the
binary topology file (<a href="tpb.html">tpb</a>
file).  The output files of 
<TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> are the
trajectory file (<TT><a href="trj.html">.trj</a></TT>
file) and a logfile (
<TT><a href="log.html">.log</A></TT> file).</p>

<br><hr><br>

<P><H1><A NAME="water">Water</A></H1>
Now you are going to simulate 216 molecules of SPC water 
(<A HREF=#berendsen81>Berendsen <it>et al.</it>, 1981</A>)
in a rectangular box. In this example the GROMACS
software team already generated most of the neccesary input
files. The files needed in this example are:
<ul>
<LI> Initial structure of a box of 216 water molecules (<TT><a href="gro.html">gro</a></TT>)
<LI> Topology file of water (<a href="top.html">top</a>)
<LI> Molecular Dynamics parameter file (<TT><a href="mdp_opt.html">mdp</a></TT>)
</ul>
<P>
Change your directory to <tt>tutor/water </tt>:   
<P><TT>
% cd tutor/water
</TT></P>
Let's first have a look at the coordinate file:
<P><TT>
% more <a href="../tutor/water/spc216.gro.txt">spc216.gro</a>
</TT></P>
Or to view the water box graphically:
<P><TT>
% rasmol <a href="../tutor/water/spc216.pdb.txt">spc216.pdb</a> 
</TT></P>
Have a look at the topology file:
<P><TT>
% more <a href="../tutor/water/water.top.txt">water.top</a>
</TT></P>
Have a look at the MD-parameters file:
<P><TT>
% more <a href="../tutor/water/water.mdp.txt">water.mdp</a>
</TT></P>
Since all the neccesary files are available, we are going to,
preprocess all the input files to create a binary topology 
(<TT><a href="tpb.html">tpb</a></TT>) file. 
This binary topology file is the only input file for the
MD-program <TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT>. 
<P><TT>
% <a href="grompp.html">grompp</a> -f water -p water -c <a href="../tutor/water/spc216.gro.txt">spc216.gro</a> -o water
</TT></P>
The binary topology file is only viewable with the program 
<TT><a href="gmxdump.html">gmxdump</a></TT>. 
In this way it is possible to check if the  preprocessor 
<TT><a href="grompp.html">grompp</a></TT> worked well.
<P><TT>
% <a href="gmxdump.html">gmxdump</a> -s water.tpb | more
</TT></P>
Now it's time to start to the simulation
<P><TT>
% <a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a> -s water.tpb -o <a href="trj.html">water.trj</a> -c <a href="gro.html">water_out.gro</a> -v -g mdlog
</TT></P>
After the MD simulation is finished, it is possible to view the
trajectory with the <a href="ngmx.html">ngmx</a> program:
<P><TT>
% <a href="ngmx.html">ngmx</a> -f <a href="trj.html">water.trj</a> -s <a href="tpb.html">water.tpb</a>
</TT></P>
Calculate a radial distribution function of the Oxygen atoms. The
index file <TT><a href="../tutor/water/oxygen.ndx.txt">oxygen.ndx</a></TT> 
contains one group with all the oxygen atoms. 
<P><TT>
% <a href="g_rdf.html">g_rdf</a> -f <a href="trj.html">water.trj</a> -n <a href="../tutor/water/oxygen.ndx.txt">oxygen.ndx</a> -o <a href="xvg.html">rdf.xvg</a> -s water.tpb
</TT></P>
view the output graph of <TT><a href="g_rdf.html">g_rdf</a></TT>
<P><TT>
% xvgr rdf.xvg 
</TT></P>
Which shows you the radial distribution function for Oxygen-Oxygen in
SPC water. </p>

<br><hr><br>

<P><H1><A NAME="spep">Ribonuclease S-peptide.</A></H1>
Ribonuclease A is a digestive enzyme, secreted by the pancreas. The enzyme
can be cleaved by subtilisin at a single peptide bond to yield 
Ribonuclease-S, a catalytically active complex of an S-peptide moiety
(residues 1-20) and an S-protein moiety (residues 21-124), bound together
by multiple non-covalent links (<A HREF=#stryer88>Stryer, 1988</A>).
<P>
The S-Peptide has been studied in many ways, experimentally
as well as theoretically (simulation) because of the high a-helix 
content in solution, which is remarkable in such a small peptide.
<P>
All the files of speptide are stored in the directory <TT>
tutor/speptide</TT>. First go to this directory:cd speptide
<P>
To be able to simulate the S-Peptide we need a starting structure. This can
be taken from the protein data bank. There are a number of different
structure for Ribonuclease S, from one of which we have cut out the
first 20 residues, and stored it in 
<TT><a href="../tutor/speptide/speptide.pdb.txt">speptide.pdb</a></TT>. 
Have a look at the file 
<P><TT>
% more <a href="../tutor/speptide/speptide.pdb.txt">speptide.pdb</a>
</TT></P>
If you have access to a molecular
graphics program such as rasmol, xmol, 
or a commercial package,
you can look at the molecule on screen, eg: 
<P><TT>
% rasmol <a href="../tutor/speptide/speptide.pdb.txt">speptide.pdb</a>
</TT></P>

The following steps have to be taken to perform a simulation of the peptide.
<ol>
<li>	Convert the pdb-file 
	<a href="../tutor/speptide/speptide.pdb.txt">speptide.pdb</a>
	to a GROMACS structure file and a GROMACS topology file.
<li>	Solvate the peptide in water
<li>	Perform an energy minimization of the peptide in solvent
<li>	Add ions if necessary (we will omit this step here)
<li>	Perform a short MD run with position restraints on the peptide
<li>	Perform full MD without restraints
<li>	Analysis
</ol>

We will describe in detail how such a simulation can be done using
, starting from a pdb-file.

<P><H3><A NAME="pdb2gmx">
Generate a a topology file (<a href="top.html">top</a>) from the pdb-file (<a href="pdb.html">pdb</a>)</a>
</H3>
<P>
Generate a molecular topology and a structure file in 
format. This can be done with the <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> program: 
<P><TT>
% <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> -f <a href="pdb.html">speptide.pdb</a> -p <a href="top.html">speptide.top</a> -o <a href="gro.html">speptide.gro</a>
</TT></P>
Note that the correct file extension are added automatically to the
filenames on the command line. 
Usually the program is non-interactive, but you can also 
have <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> ask you 
about which forcefield to use, about protonation of residues, and
about protonation of N- and C-terminus. For now we will assume no interaction
is necessary. You can type
<P><TT>
% <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> -h
</TT></P>
to see the available options.
<P>
The <a href="pdb2gmx.html">
pdb2gmx</a> program has generated a topology file 
<TT><a href="top.html">speptide.top</a></TT> and a
GROMACS structure file <tt>speptide.gro</tt> and it will 
generate hydrogen
positions. The <tt>-p</tt> and <tt>-o</tt> options with he
filenames are optional; without them the files <TT><a href="top.html">topol.top</a></TT> and <TT>
<a href="gro.html">conf.gro</a></TT> will be generated.
Now have a look at the output from <a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a>,
<P><TT>
% more <a href="gro.html">speptide.gro</a>
</TT></P>
You will see a close resemblance to the <a href="pdb.html">pdb</a> file, only the layout of
the file is a bit different. For the exact layout check 
<a href="gro.html">gro.html</a>.
Also do have a look at the topology 
<P><TT>
% more <a href="top.html">speptide.top</a>
</TT></P>
You will see a large file containing the atom types, the physical
bonds between atoms, etcetera. If you want to know more about 
the topology file read 
<a href="top.html">top.html</a>.


<P><H3><A NAME="solvate">
Solvate the peptide in a periodic box filled with water</A></H3>
This is done using the programs
<a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> and
<a href="genbox.html">genbox</a>.
<a href="editconf.html">editconf</a>
will make a rectangular box with empty space of user specified size
around the molecule. 
<a href="genbox.html">genbox</a>
will read the structure file and fill the box with water.
<P><TT>
% <a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> -f speptide -o -dc 0.6
% <a href="genbox.html">genbox</a> -cp out -cs -p speptide -o b4em
</TT></P>
The program prints some lines of user information, like the volume of
the box and the number of water molecules added to your
peptide. <TT><a href="genbox.html">genbox</a></TT>
also changes the topology file 
<TT><a href="top.html">speptide.top</a></TT> to include
these water molecules in the topology. This can been seen by looking
at the bottom of the 
<TT><a href="top.html">speptide.top</a></TT> file
<P><TT>
% tail <a href="top.html">speptide.top</a>
</TT></P>
You will see some lines like 
<P><TT>
[ system ]
; Name		Number
Protein		1
SOL		N
</TT></P>
where <tt>N</tt> is the number of water molecules added to your system by
<TT><a href="genbox.html">genbox</a></TT>.
<P>

It is also possible to solvate a peptide in another solvent such as
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), as has been done by 
<A HREF=#mierke91>Mierke & Kessler, 1991</A>.

<P><H3><A NAME="indexfile">Generate index file (<TT><a href="ndx.html">.ndx</a></TT> extension)</A></H3>
By default, most GROMACS programs generate a set of index groups to select
the most common subsets of atoms from your system (e.g. Protein, Backbone,
C-alpha's, Solute, etc.).
For the special cases when you need to select other groups than the
default ones, an <a href="ndx.html">index file</a>
can be generated using <a href="make_ndx.html">make_ndx</a>. 
This is an interactive program that lets you manipulate molecules,
residues and atom. It's use should be self-explanatory.  To invoke the
program you would
<P><TT>
% <a href="make_ndx.html">make_ndx</a> -f b4em
</TT></P>
but don't bother for now.

<P><H3><A NAME="em">Perform an energy minimization of the peptide in solvent</A></H3>

Now we have to perform an <EM>energy minimization</EM> of the
structure to remove the local strain in the peptide (due to generation
of hydrogen positions) and to remove bad Van der Waals contacts
(particles that are too close). This can be done with the
<TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> program which
is the MD and EM program. Before we can use the 
<TT> <a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> program
however, we have to preprocess the topology file (
<TT><a href="top.html">speptide.top</a></TT>), the
structure file (
<TT><a href="gro.html">speptide.gro</a></TT>) and a
special parameter file (
<TT><a href="../tutor/speptide/em.mdp.txt">em.mdp</a></TT>). Check
the contents of this file 
<P><TT>
% more <a href="../tutor/speptide/em.mdp.txt">em.mdp</a>
</TT></P>
Preprocessing is done with the preprocessor called 
<TT><a href="grompp.html">grompp</a></TT>. This reads
up the files just mentioned:

<P><TT>
% <a href="grompp.html">grompp</a> -v -f em -c b4em -n analysis -o em -p speptide
</TT></P>
In this command the <tt>-v</tt> option turns on verbose mode, which
gives a little bit of clarifying info on what the program is doing.
We now have made a <EM>binary topology</EM> (<TT>em.tpb</TT>) which
serves as input for the 
<TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> program. Now
we can do the energy minimization:
<P><TT>
% <a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a> -v -s em -o em -c after_em -g emlog
</TT></P>
In this command the <tt>-v</tt> option turns on verbose mode again.
The <tt>-o</tt> option sets the filename for the trajectory file,
which is not very important in energy minimizations. The <tt>-c</tt>
option sets the filename of the structure file after energy
minimization. This file we will subsequently use as input for the MD
run.  The energy minimization takes some time, the amount depending on
the CPU in your computer, the load of your computer, etc. The 
<TT><a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a></TT> program is
automatically <EM>niced</EM>; it runs at low priority. All programs
that do extensive computations are automatically run at low
priority. For most modern workstations this computation should be a
matter of minutes. The minimization is finished when either the
minimization has converged or a fixed number of steps has been
performed.  Since the system consists merely of water, a quick check
on the potential energy should reveal whether the minimization was
successful: the potential energy of 1 SPC water molecule at 300 K is
<tt>-42</tt> kJ mole<sup>-1</sup>. Since we have about <tt>9e+02</tt>
SPC molecules the potential energy should be about <tt>-40e+3</tt> kJ
mole<sup>-1</sup>. If the potential energy after minimization is lower
than <tt>-30e+03</tt> kJ mole<sup>-1</sup> it is acceptable and the
structure can be used for MD calculations.  After our EM calculation
the program prints something like:
<P><TT>
STEEPEST DESCENTS converged to 0.001000 
Function value at minimum = -3.4772e+04
</TT></P>
which means our criterium is met, and we can proceed to the next step.

<P><H3><A NAME="posres">
Perform a short MD run with position restraints on the peptide</A>
</H3>
Position restrained MD means Molecular Dynamics in which a part of the
system is not allowed to move far off their starting positions.  To be
able to run with position restraints we must add a section to the
<TT><a href="top.html">speptide.top</a></TT> file,
describing which atoms are to be restrained. Such a section is
actually generated by the 
<a href="pdb2gmx.html">pdb2gmx</a> program. In the
topology file it looks like
<P><TT>
#ifdef POSRES
#include "<a href="itp.html">posres.itp</a>"
#endif
</TT></P>
In the <a href="top.html">topology file</a> we use
conditional inclusion, i.e. only if a variable <TT>POSRES</TT> is set
in the preprocessor do we include the file, this allows us to use the
same topology file for runs with and without position restraints. In
the <a href="../tutor/speptide/pr.mdp.txt">pr.mdp</a> parameter file 
for the position restraints this variable is set indeed:
<P><TT>
define              =  -DPOSRES
</TT></P>
<P>
At last we can generate the input for the position restrained mdrun:
<P><TT>
% <a href="grompp.html">grompp</a> -f pr -o pr -c after_em -r after_em -n analysis -p speptide
</TT></P>
Now it's <a href="mdrun.html">MDrun</a> time:
<P><TT>
% <a href="mdrun.html">mdrun</a> -v -s pr -e pr -o pr -c after_pr -g prlog >& pr.job &
</TT></P>
This run is started in the background (it will take a while), you
can watch how long it will take by typing:
<P><TT>
% tail -f pr.job
</TT></P>
With the <tt>Ctrl-C</tt> key you can kill the <tt>tail</tt> command.
A good check of your simulation is to see whether density and potential
energies have converged:
<P><TT>
% <a href="g_energy.html">g_energy</a> -f pr -o out -w
</TT></P>
The <a href="g_energy.html">
g_energy</a> program will prompt you to select a number of energy terms
from a list. For potential energy type:
<P><TT>
20 0
</TT></P>
If you have the xmgr program installed it will automatically pop up on your
screen with the energy plot. You can do the same for the density
and other energy terms, such as Solvent-Protein interactions.

<P><H3><A NAME="full">Perform full MD without restraints</A></H3>
Full MD is very similar to the restrained MD as far as GROMACS is
concerned. Check out the <a href="../tutor/speptide/full.mdp.txt">full.mdp</a>
for details.
<P><TT>
% <a href="grompp.html">grompp</a> -v -f full -o full -c after_pr
</TT></P>

You should do similar convergence checks (and more!) as for the position
restrained simulation.

<P><H3><A NAME="analysis">Analysis</A></H3>
We will not describe analysis in detail, because most analysis tools
are described in the Analysis chapter of the printed manual.
We just list a few of the possibilities within GROMACS. By now you should be
able to start programs yourself.
<P><UL>
<LI> View the trajectory on your own X-screen (program 
<a href="ngmx.html">ngmx</a>).
<li> Monitor energies using 
	<a href="g_energy.html">g_energy</a>.

<li> Root Mean Square Deviation with respect to the crystal
	structure (program 
	<a href="g_rms.html">g_rms</a>).
<LI> Radius of Gyration (program 
	<a href="g_gyrate.html">g_gyrate</a>).	).
<LI> Secondary Structure analysis (program 
	<a href="do_dssp.html">do_dssp</a>).
	For this analysis you should have the dssp 
	(<A HREF=#kabsch83>Kabsch & Sander, 1983</A>)
	software installed. This program also produces
	the solvent accesible surface area as a function of time.
<LI> Ramachandran Plots (program 
	<a href="g_rama.html">g_rama</a>).
<LI> Salt Bridge analysis (program 
	<a href="g_saltbr.html">g_saltbr</a>).
</ul>
<P>
You have been witness of a full MD simulation starting from a pdb-file.
It's that easy, but then again, maybe it was not that easy. The
example presented here is a <EM>real</EM> example, this is how a 
production run should be performed, the complexity is in the process 
itself and not in the software (at least, that's our opinion).</p>

<P><H1><A NAME="you">Your own System.</A></H1>
<P>
For proteins in water (or other solvent) the route is described above. 
For other systemd (eg. pure liquids or mixtures) one needs:
<ul> 
<li> 	The atomic coordinates, which can be generated by a variety of 
	interactive programs (eg. Quanta, Cerius, HyperChem). 
	Coordinate files can be exported in pdb-format and 
	converted to <a href="gro.html">.gro</a> format by 
	the <a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> program:
	<P><TT>
% <a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> -f <a href="pdb.html">conf.pdb</a> -o <a href="gro.html">conf.gro</a>
	</TT></P>
	where <TT><a href="gro.html">conf.gro</a></TT> is the  coordinatefile, 
	or converted back to pdb-format by
	<P><TT>
% <a href="editconf.html">editconf</a> -f <a href="gro.html">conf.gro</a> -o <a href="pdb.html">conf.pdb</a>
	</TT></P>
	where <TT>conf</TT> is a file with  coordinates, and <TT>
	<a href="pdb.html">conf.pdb</a></TT> is the target file in <a href="pdb.html">.pdb</a> format.
	<b>NOTE:</b> Make sure that the graphics programs export 
	<b>whole</b> molecules instead of molecules that are cut in pieces
	(due to the periodic boundary conditions)
	If you have the coordinates of single molecules, you can also 
	build systems (pure liquids or mixtures) with 
	<a href="genbox.html">genbox</a>.
	In contrast, the program
	<a href="genconf.html">genconf</a>
	produces the lattice of molecules with random displacements.
<li> 	The topology you have to build yourself. Of course you can 
	include topologies of part of your system (eg. <TT><a href="itp.html">spc.itp</a></TT>, 
	<TT><a href="itp.html">decane.itp</a></TT> etc.) 
</ul>

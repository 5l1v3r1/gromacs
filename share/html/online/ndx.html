<h1>ndx file format</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
The gromacs index file (usually called index.ndx) contains some
user definable sets of atoms. The file can be read by
most analysis programs, by the graphics program (<a href=ngmx.html>ngmx</a>) 
and by the preprocessor (<a href=grompp.html>grompp</a>).
Most of these programs create default index groups when no index
file is supplied, so you only need to make an index file when you need special
groups.  
<p>

An example file is here:
<pre>
[ Oxygen ]
1 	4 	7 
[ Hydrogen ]
2	3	5	6
8	9
</pre>

There are two groups, and total nine atoms. The first group
<b>Oxygen</b> has 3 elements.
The second group <b>Hydrogen</b> has 6 elements.

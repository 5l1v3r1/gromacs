<h1>ndx file format</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
The gromacs index file (usually called index.ndx) contains some
user definable sets of eg. atoms. The file is read by
most analysis programs, by the graphics program (<a href=ngmx.html>ngmx</a>) 
and by the preprocessor (<a href=grompp.html>grompp</a>).

Some examples of why this file is useful:
<ul>
<li>You have done a simulation of diffusion of small molecules
through a polymer membrane, and you want to calculate the
diffusion constant (using <a href=g_msd.html>g_msd</a>). 
You have written out some timeframes
of coordinates. In the index file you specify the atom numbers
of the small molecules you want to calculate the mean-
square displacement of. The analysis program reads the index
file and prompts you to select the groups (of atoms) you want
to do the analysis on.
<li>You have a complicated system, which you want to see an 
animated trajectory of. You can leave hydrogens from the menu in the
graphics program, but you can make more powerful selection
with the filter option, which lets you select groups of atoms
from your index file.
</ul>
<p>

An example file is here:
<pre>
2 	9
Oxygen 		3 	0 	3 	6 
Hydrogen 	6	1	2	4	5	7	8
</pre>

There are two groups, and total nine atoms. The first group
<b>Oxygen</b> has 3 elements (0, 3 and 6). The second group
<b>Hydrogen</b> has 6 elements (1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8).

An indexfile generation tool is available: <a href=make_ndx.html>make_ndx</a>
For special things you can easily write a small program yourself.

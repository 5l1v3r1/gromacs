<h1>gip file format</h1>
Files with the gip file extension contain input data for the 
<a href="genion.html">genion</a> program.<p>
A sample is included below.<p>
<pre>
n+                  =  20	; # positive ions
name+               =  Na	; Name of thes ions
q+                  =  1.0	; Charge
n-                  =  0	; # negative ions
name-               =  		; Name of these ions
q-                  =  -1.0	; Charge of these ions
water-1             =  3172	; Atom number of first water -1 in the
				; coordinate file. NOTE the atom numbers
				; for genion start at 0, so 1 must be 
				; subtracted from the first water in your
				; coordinates.
n-water             =  846	; # of water molecules
rexcl               =  0.50	; Distance within which no two ions may be put

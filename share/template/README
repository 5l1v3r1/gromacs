Once installed, this directory contains a Makefile and 
a small program that you could use as a template when 
writing your own analysis software.

The Makefile is created during the configuration phase
to contain the correct paths and libraries to the most
recent installation. 
It might be a good idea to make a copy if you plan to 
compile for several architectures.

----------------------------------------------------------
If you are looking in the distribution directory the
there will be a Makefile.am which automake uses to 
create a Makefile.in which in turn is converted to
a Makefile by the configure script. Note that this is
NOT the template makefile - it is called Template.mak,
but is renamed when then 


You should NOT touch or copy Makefile.in unless you
really know what you are doing - it is a template file
used by the configure script to create the real Makefile.

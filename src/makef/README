In the Makefile.$CPU you set compiler, linker & archiver to use
on your machine.

In the table below you'll find some info about the variables
these are just example values that may be usefull on your machine

Variable=	Value			Meaning
SYSDEFS	=	-DHAVE_ULONG		System dependent defines, which
					usually must not be changed
CC	= 	cc			This is the Ansi-C compiler
CFLAGS	=	-O2			C Compiler Flags (optimize)
LDFLAGS	= 	-g -L$(LIBDIR)		Linker options
LD	= 	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS)	The link command
F77     =       f77                     Fortran compiler (optional)
FFLAGS  =       -O3                     Fortran compiler options
SYSLIBS = 	-lm             	System dependent default
					libraries
XLIBS	= 	$(SYSLIBS) -lX11	System libraries for X-Windows
ARFLAGS	= 	q			The options for the archiver (to make
					GROMACS	library files from objects)
RANLIB	= 	echo			Some systems use ranlib to postprocess
					library files (esp. BSD systems)
X11INC	= 	-I/usr1/local/include	Include directory for X Windows 
					header files

SHAREIT	  Optional, here you can enter the compile line to make a static
	  library shared, Gromacs will then use shared libraries

CC_MKINL  Optional, special compile command for mkinl 
LD_MKINL  Optional, special link command for mkinl 
          These options are needed for machines which produce code which only
	  runs in parallel, such as IBM SP2. mkinl is needed at compile time
	  to make the innerloops and does not run in parallel.
#
#       MDRUN STUFF
#
#
RUNLDOPT     Special link options for mdrun
LINKSTATIC   Option to link the gromacs libraries static
LINKDYNAMIC  Option to link the system libraries dynamic
#
PARALLEL_MDRUN_ONLY  Useful only when compiling parallel code on machines
		     which can not execute non-parallel programs linked
		     with the mpi (or pvm) library, such as IBM SP2.
		     When set to yes only mdrun is made and placed
		     in a directory ending in _mpi or _pvm,
		     the libraries are also in seperate diretories.

#	USER MODIFIABLE SECTION
#
#WARNING
#WARNING The fortran innerloop is tested only on SUN and SGI machines
#WARNING				
# 	If you want to use fortran innerloops set this to yes
USEF77		= yes
#
#       If you want to use MPI to run in parallel set this to yes
USE_MPI         = no
#	If you want to use PVM to run in parallel set this to yes
USE_PVM3	= no
#	If you want to use portable binary files set this to yes
USE_XDR		= yes

# Note that these variables are also used in Makefile.std
# If you experience any problems using PVM also check that file.

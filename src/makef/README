In the Makefile.$CPU you set compiler, linker & archiver to use
on your machine.

In the table below you'll find some info about the variables
these are just example values that may be usefull on your machine

Variable=	Value			Meaning
SYSDEFS	=	-DHAVE_ULONG		System dependent defines, which
					usually must not be changed
CC	= 	cc			This is the Ansi-C compiler
CCC	= 	CC			This is the C++ Compiler
CFLAGS	=	-O2			C Compiler Flags (optimize)
CCFLAGS	= 	-O2			C++ Compiler Flags (optimize)
LDFLAGS	= 	-g -L$(LIBDIR)		Linker options
LD	= 	$(CC) $(LDFLAGS)	The link command
CCLD	=	$(CCC) $(LDFLAGS)	The link command for c++
SYSLIBS = 	-lm -lsocket		System dependent default
					libraries
XLIBS	= 	$(SYSLIBS) -lX11	System libraries for X-Windows
ARFLAGS	= 	q			The options for the archiver (to make
					GROMACS	library files from objects)
RANLIB	= 	echo			Some systems use ranlib to postprocess
					library files (esp. BSD systems)
X11INC	= 	-I/usr1/local/include	Include directory for X Windows 
					header files

#WARNING The fortran innerloop is tested only on SUN and SGI machines
#WARNING				
# 	If you want to use fortran innerloops set this to yes
USEF77		= yes
#	If you don't have PVM (parallel virtual machines) set this to no
#	else set the path and CPU variable accordingly, below
USE_PVM3	= no
#	If you want to use compressed data files set this to yes
USE_XDR		= yes

# Note that these variables are also used in Makefile.std
# If you experience any problems using PVM also check that file.

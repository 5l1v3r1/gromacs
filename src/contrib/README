This directory contains programs and scripts contributed by the
GROMACS developers and users. It is not really officially supported
or documented, so if there are problems your best bet is probably
either the mailing lists or to contact the author listed in the file.

To add a program, you should edit Makefile.am. Have a look at 
developer.gromacs.org if you are unfamiliar with automake/autoconf.
Unfortunately there is a bug in automake 1.4. Until 1.5 is released,
make sure you use either version 1.3 or version 1.4d that is available
from ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/automake/

The EXTRA_PROGRAMS tag used here means they are not compiled and
installed for the default package configuration setup.

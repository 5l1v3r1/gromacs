This directory contains programs and scripts contributed by the
GROMACS developers and users. It is not really officially supported
or documented, so if there are problems your best bet is probably
either the mailing lists or to contact the author listed in the file.

To add a program, you should edit Makefile.am. Have a look at 
www.gromacs.org/developer if you are unfamiliar with automake/autoconf.
Since gromacs uses both assembly, fortran, shared libraries and 
dynamic dependency tracking on all platforms we rely on features in
the prereleases of autoconf 1.5. Until this is released,
you can get version 1.4h or later from ftp.gromacs.org/developer

The EXTRA_PROGRAMS tag used here means they are not compiled and
installed for the default package configuration setup.

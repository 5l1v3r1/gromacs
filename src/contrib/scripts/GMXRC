# This is a template to create a GMXRC file for your site, 
# to make GROMACS 3.0 behave like previous versions.
# You can put it either in the central GROMACS directory,
# or in your own homedirectory.
#
# It still requires a C shell environment, and you will
# probably need to change the next few lines to fit
# your installation:

# First we remove previous GROMACS environment if present.
source /usr/local/gromacs/NOGMX -quiet

# Set the GROMACS home directory
setenv GMXHOME	/usr/local/gromacs

# If you support multiple machines then it's useful to 
# have a switch statement here, which, depending on hostname
# point to the proper directories, and sets the GMXCPU variable
# 
# For easy updating, it is also recommended to put you local
# stuff in the GMXRC.local file
# Don't forget the GMXARCH variable
#
setenv	LOCAL_RC	$GMXHOME/GMXRC.local
if ( -f $LOCAL_RC ) then
	source	$LOCAL_RC
else
# Here are some defaults, if you have one machine, edit these
	setenv	GMXARCH i686-pc-linux-gnu
endif

# Some directories that live below the root
setenv GMXBIN 	$GMXHOME/bin/$GMXARCH
setenv GMXLIB	$GMXHOME/top

# 
# Default Graphics Font
#
setenv GMXFONT	10x20

#
# Set the path #
setenv 	PATH 	"$PATH":"$GMXBIN"
#

if ( $?LD_LIBRARY_PATH ) then
	 setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH	"$LD_LIBRARY_PATH":$GMXHOME/lib/$GMXARCH
else
	 setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH	$GMXHOME/lib/$GMXARCH
endif
if ( $?MANPATH ) then
	setenv 	MANPATH		"$MANPATH":$GMXHOME/man
else
	setenv  MANPATH         /usr/man:$GMXHOME/man  
endif

# Now finally, if you consider our Cool Quotes to be offensive
# you might considering including this command:
# setenv	IAMCOOL	NO

if ( -f $GMXHOME/complete ) source $GMXHOME/complete

# end of script

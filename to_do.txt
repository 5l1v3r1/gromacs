# To-do list for getting this code to the level of publication

* Histidines lead to segfaults.
 (ERIK)
* constraints?
  Does it work with SHAKE? All-bonds? H-bonds?
  (HAIYANG)
* There are differences in Ecoul with ICE turned on/off.
  ** Test pure water
  (HAIYANG)
  ** See which particles have interactions turned on
  (ERIK)
* Move do_titration to a point AFTER the calculation of full-step velocities.
  This could make energy conservaion easier. Test this when the rest works.
* See that the regressiontests have all tests needed.

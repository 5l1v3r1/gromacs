# To-do list for getting this code to the level of publication

* Histidines lead to segfaults.
  FIXED
  (ERIK)

* constraints?
  ** Almost works with SHAKE.
  FIXED
  ** Dosen't work with LINCS. Possibly because the bond history is part of the algorithm.

* There are differences in Ecoul with ICE turned on/off.
  ** Test pure water
  NO DIFFERENCE
  (HAIYANG)
  ** See which particles have interactions turned on
  (ERIK)
  Wrong hydrogens are turned on/off
  FIXED NOW!

* Move do_titration to a point AFTER the calculation of full-step velocities.
  This could make energy conservaion easier. Test this when the rest works.

* See that the regressiontests have all tests needed.

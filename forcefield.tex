\chapter{The Gromacs force field}
\label{ch:ff}
A \normindex{force field} is built up from two distinct components:
\begin{itemize}
\item The set of equations (called the {\em \normindex{potential
function}s}) used to generate the potential energies and their
derivatives, the forces.
\item The parameters used in this set of equations
\end{itemize}
Within one set of equations various sets of parameters can be
used. Care must be taken that the combination of equations and
parameters form a consistent set. It is in general dangerous to make
{\em ad hoc} changes in a subset of parameters, because the various
contributions to the total force are usually interdependent.

In {\gromacs} {\gmxver} the force field is based on
\normindex{GROMOS}-87~\cite{biomos},
with a small modification concerning the interaction between
water-oxygens and carbon atoms~\cite{Buuren93b,Mark94}, as well as 10
extra atomtypes~\cite{Jorgensen83,Buuren93a,Buuren93b,Mark94,Liu95}.
However, the user is free to make her own modifications (beware!).
This will be explained in details in chapter~\ref{ch:top}, which deals
with the {\bf Topology}.\\ To accomodate the potential functions used
in some popular force fields, {\gromacs} offers a choice of functions,
both for non-bonded interaction and for dihedral interactions. They
are described in the appropriate subsections.

\section{Potentials}
The potential functions can be subdivided into three parts
\begin{enumerate}
\item	{\em Non-bonded}: Lennard-Jones or Buckingham, and Coulomb or
modified Coulomb. The non-bonded interactions are computed on the
basis of a neighbour list (a list of non-bonded atoms within a certain
radius), in which exclusions are already removed.
\item	{\em Bonded}: covalent bond-stretching, angle-bending,
improper dihedrals, and proper dihedrals. These are computed on the
basis of fixed lists. 
\item	{\em Special}: position restraints and distance restraints,
based on fixed lists. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Non-bonded interactions}
Non-bonded interactions in {\gromacs} are pair-additive and centro-symmetric:
\beq
V(\ve{r}_1,\ldots \ve{r}_N) = \sum_{i<j}V_{ij}(\ve{r}_{ij});
\eeq
\beq
\ve{F}_i = -\sum_j \frac{dV_{ij}(r_{ij})}{dr_{ij}} \frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} = -\ve{F}_j
\eeq
The non-bonded interactions contain a \normindex{repulsion} term, 
a \normindex{dispersion}
term, and a Coulomb term. The repulsion and dispersion term are
combined in either the Lennard-Jones (or 6-12 interaction), or the
Buckinghgam (or exp-6 potential). In addition, (partially) charged atoms
act through the Coulomb term. 

\subsection{The Lennard-Jones interaction}
\label{sec:lj}
The \normindex{Lennard Jones} potential $V_{LJ}$ between two atoms equals
\beq
V_{LJ}(\rij) =	\frac{C_{ij}^{(12)}}{\rij^{12}} -
			\frac{C_{ij}^{(6)}}{\rij^6}	
\eeq
The parameters $C^{(12)}_{ij}$ and $C^{(6)}_{ij}$  depend on pairs of
{\em atomtypes}; consequently they are taken from a matric of
LJ-parameters.
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_lj.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {The Lennard-Jones interaction}
\label{fig:lj}
\end {figure}
 
The force derived from this potential is:
\beq
\ve{F}_i(\rvij) = \left( 12~\frac{C_{ij}^{(12)}}{\rij^{12}} -
				 6~\frac{C_{ij}^{(6)}}{\rij^6} \right) \rnorm 
\eeq

The LJ potential may also be written in the following form :
\beq
V_{LJ}(\rvij) = 4\epsilon_{ij}\left(\left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}} {\rij}\right)^{12}
		- \left(\frac{\sigma_{ij}}{\rij}\right)^{6} \right)
\label{eqn:sigeps}	
\eeq

In constructing the parameter matrix for the non-bonded LJ-parameters,
two types of combination rules can be used within {\gromacs}: 
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
C_{ij}^{(6)}	&=& \left({C_{ii}^{(6)} * C_{jj}^{(6)}}\right)^{1/2}	\\
C_{ij}^{(12)}	&=& \left({C_{ii}^{(12)} * C_{jj}^{(12)}}\right)^{1/2}
\label{eqn:comb}
\end{array}
\eeq
or, alternatively,
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
 \sigma_{ij}   &=& \frac{1}{ 2}(\sigma_{ii}+\sigma_{jj})	\\
 \epsilon_{ij} &=& \left({\epsilon_{ii} \epsilon_{jj}}\right)^{1/2}
\end{array}
\eeq

\subsection{Buckingham potential}
The \normindex{Buckingham} 
potential has a more flexible and realistic repulsion term
than the Lennard Jones interaction, but is also more expensive to
compute. The potential form is:
\beq
V_{bh}(\rij) = A_{ij} \exp(-B_{ij} \rij) -
			\frac{C_{ij}}{\rij^6}
\eeq
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_bham.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {The Buckingham interaction}
\label{fig:bham}
\end {figure}

the force derived from this is:
\beq
 \ve{F}_i(\rij) = \left[ -A_{ij}B_{ij}\rij exp(-B_{ij} \rij) -
				 6\frac{C_{ij}}{\rij^6} \right] \rnorm
\eeq

\subsection{Coulomb interaction}
\label{sec:coul}
\newcommand{\epsr}{\varepsilon_r}
\newcommand{\epsrf}{\varepsilon_{rf}}
The \normindex{Coulomb} interaction between two charge particles is given by:
\beq
V_c(\rij) = f \frac{q_i q_j}{\epsr \rij}
\eeq
where $f = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} = 138.935\,485$ (see Chapter~\ref{ch:defunits})
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/vcrf.eps,width=8cm}}
\caption{The Coulomb interaction (for particles with equal signed
charge) with and without reaction field. In the latter case $\epsrf$
was 78, and $r_c$ was 0.9 nm. The dot-dashed line is the same as the
dashed line, except for a constant.}
\label{fig:coul}
\end {figure}

The force derived from this potential is:
\beq
\ve{F}_i(\rvij) = f \frac{q_i q_j}{\epsr\rij^2}\rnorm
\eeq

In {\gromacs} the  relative \normindex{dielectric constant} 
\normindex{$\epsr$}
may be set in the in the input for {\tt grompp}. 

\subsection{Coulomb interaction with reaction field}
\label{sec:coulrf}
The coulomb interaction can be modified for homogeneous systems, by
assuming a constant dielectric environment beyond the cut-off $r_c$
with a dielectric constant of {$\epsrf$}. The interaction then reads:
\beq
V_{crf}	~=~	f \frac{q_i q_j}{\rij}\left[1+\frac{\epsrf-1}{2\epsrf+1}\frac{\rij^3}{r_c^3}\right] - f\frac{q_i q_j}{r_c}\frac{3\epsrf}{2\epsrf+1}
\eeq
in which the constant expression on the right makes the potential
zero at the cut-off $r_c$. We can rewrite this for simplicity as
\beq
V_{crf}	~=~	f q_i q_j\left[\frac{1}{\rij} + k_{rf}~ \rij^2 -c_{rf}\right]
\eeq
with
\bea
k_{rf}	&=&	\frac{1}{r_c^3}\,\frac{\epsrf-1}{(2\epsrf+1)}	\\
\label{eqn:krf}
c_{rf}	&=&	\frac{1}{r_c}+k_{rf}\,r_c^2 ~=~ \frac{1}{r_c}\,\frac{3\epsrf}{(2\epsrf+1)}
\label{eqn:crf}
\eea
for large $\epsrf$ the $k_{rf}$ goes to 0.5~$r_c^{-3}$,
while for $\epsrf$ = 1 the correction vanishes.
This makes it possible to use
the same expression with and without reaction field, albeit at some
computational cost. 
In figure~\ref{fig:coul}
the modified interaction is plotted, and it is clear that the derivative 
with respect to $\rij$ (= -force) goes to zero at the cut-off distance.
The force derived from this potential reads:
\beq
\ve{F}_i(\rvij) = f q_i q_j\left[\frac{1}{\rij^2} - 2 k_{rf}\rij\right]\rnorm
\eeq
Tironi {\etal} have introduced a \myindex{generalized reaction field} in which
the dielectric continuum beyond the cut-off $r_c$ also has an ionic strength
$I$~\cite{Tironi95}. In this case we can rewrite the constants $k_{rf}$ and 
$c_{rf}$ using the inverse Debye screening length $\kappa$:
\bea
\kappa	&=&	\frac{2 I \,F^2}{\varepsilon_0 \epsrf RT}=\frac{F^2}{\varepsilon_0 \epsrf RT}\sum_{i=1}^{K} c_i z_i	\\
k_{rf}	&=&	\frac{1}{r_c^3}\,\frac{(\epsrf-1)(1+\kappa r_c) + \epsrf(\kappa r_c)^2}{(2\epsrf+1)(1+\kappa r_c) + \epsrf(\kappa r_c)^2}	\\
\label{eqn:kgrf}
c_{rf}	&=&	\frac{1}{r_c}\,\frac{3\epsrf(1+\kappa r_c)+2\epsrf(\kappa r_c)^2}{(2\epsrf+1)(1+\kappa r_c) + \epsrf(\kappa r_c)^2}
\label{eqn:cgrf}
\eea
where $F$ is Faraday's constant, $R$ is the ideal gas constant, $T$ the
absolute temperature, $c_i$ the molar concentration for
species $i$ and $z_i$ the charge number of species $i$ where we have $K$
different species. In the limit of zero ionic strength ($\kappa$ = 0)
eqns.~\ref{eqn:kgrf} and ~\ref{eqn:cgrf} reduce to the simple forms
of eqns.~\ref{eqn:krf} and ~\ref{eqn:crf} respectively.

\subsection{Modified Coulomb interaction}
In the {\gromacs} force field the coulomb force can be modified by
a shift function. The purpose of this is to replace the truncated
forces by forces that are continuous and have continuous derivatives
at the \normindex{cut-off} radius. With such forces the time-step integration
produces much smaller errors and there are no such complications as
creating charges from dipoles by the truncation procedure. In fact, by
using shifted forces there is no need for charge groups in the
construction of neighbour lists. However, the shift function produces
a considerable modification of the Coulomb potential. Unless the
'missing' long-range potential is properly calculated and added (later
version of {\gromacs}!), the effect of such modifications must be
carefully evaluated. 
 
There is {\em no} fundamental difference between a switch function
(that multiplies the potential with a function) and a shift function
(the latter adds a function to the force or potential). The switch
function is a special case of the shift function, which we apply to
the {\em force function} $F(r)$, related to the electrostatic force
acting on particle $i$ by particle $j$ as
\beq
\ve{F}_i = f F(r_{ij}) q_i q_j \frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}
\eeq
For pure Coulombic interaction $F(r)=F_c(r)=\frac{1}{r^2}$. The
shifted force $F_s(r)$ can generally be written as:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vspace{2mm}
F_s(r)~=&~F_c(r)	& r < r_1		\\
\vspace{2mm}
F_s(r)~=&~F_c(r)+S(r)	& r_1 \le r < r_c	\\
F_s(r)~=&~0		& r_c \le r	
\end{array}
\eeq
When $r_1=0$ this is a traditional shift function, otherwise it acts as a 
switch function. The corresponding shifted coulomb potential then reads:
\beq
V_s(r_{ij}) = f \Phi_s (r_{ij}) q_i q_j
\eeq
where $\Phi(r)$ is the potential function 
\beq
\Phi_s(r) =  \int^{\infty}_r~F_s(x)\, dx
\eeq

The {\gromacs} shift function should be smooth at the boundaries, therefore
the following boundary conditions are imposed on the shift function:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
S(r_1)		&=&0		\\
S'(r_1)		&=&0		\\
S(r_c)		&=&-F_c(r_c)	\\
S'(r_c)		&=&-F_c'(r_c)
\end{array}
\eeq
A 3$^{rd}$ degree polynomial of the form
\beq
S(r) = A(r-r_1)^2 + B(r-r_1)^3
\eeq
fulfils these requirements. The constants A and B are given by the
boundary condition at $r_c$: 
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\vspace{2mm}
A	&~=~&	-\displaystyle\frac{5r_c~-~2r_1} {r_c^3~(r_c-r_1)^2} \\
B	&~=~&	\displaystyle\frac{4r_c~-~2r_1}{r_c^3~(r_c-r_1)^3}
\end{array}
\eeq
Thus the total force function is
\beq
F_s(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} + A(r-r_1)^2 + B(r-r_1)^3
\eeq
and the potential function reads
\beq
\Phi(r) = \frac{1}{r} - \frac{A}{3} (r-r_1)^3 - \frac{B}{4} (r-r_1)^4 - C
\eeq
where 
\beq
C =  \frac{1}{r_c} - \frac{A}{3} (r_c-r_1)^3 - \frac{B}{4} (r_c-r_1)^4
\eeq

When $r_1$ = 0, the force function is
\beq
 F_s(r) = \frac{1}{r^2} - \frac{5 r^2}{r_c^4} + \frac{4 r^3}{r_c^5}
\eeq
identical to the {\em \normindex{parabolic force}} 
function recommended to be used as a short-range function in 
conjunction with a \normindex{Poisson solver} 
for the long-range part~\cite{Berendsen93a}. The potential function is
\beq
\Phi(r) = \frac{1}{r} - \frac{5}{3r_c} + \frac{5r^3}{3r_c^4} - \frac{r^4}{r_c^5}
\eeq

\end {figure}


\subsection{Bonded interactions}
Bonded interactions are based on a fixed list of atoms. They are not
exclusively pair interactions, but include 3- and 4-body interactions
as well. There are {\em bond stretching} (2-body), {\em bond angle}
(3-body), and {\em dihedral angle} (4-body) interactions. A special
type of dihedral interaction (called {\em improper dihedral} is used
to force atoms to remain in a plane or to prevent transition to a
configuration of opposite chirality (a mirror image).  

\subsection{Bond stretching}
The \normindex{bond stretching} between two covalently bonded atoms
$i$ and $j$ is represented by a harmonic potential
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\raisebox{-1.8cm}{\psfig{figure=plots/bstretch.eps,angle=270,width=5cm}}\psfig{figure=plots/f_bond.eps,angle=270,width=7cm}}
\caption{Principle of the Bond stretch potential (left), and Bond
Stretching Potential (right)}
\label{fig:bstretch1}
\end {figure}

\beq
V_b~(\rij) = \half k^b_{ij}(\rij-b_{ij})^2
\eeq
with the force
\beq
\ve{F}_i(\rvij)	= k^b_{ij}(\rij-b_{ij}) \rnorm
\eeq

\subsection{Morse potential bond stretching}
%\author{F.P.X. Everdij}
%
For some systems that require an anharmonic bond stretching potential,
the Morse potential between two atoms {\it i} and {\it j} is available
in GROMACS. This potential differs from the harmonic potential in
having an asymmetric potential well and a zero force at infinite
distance The functional form is:
\beq
\displaystyle V_{morse} (r_{ij}) = D_{ij} [1 - exp(-\beta_{ij}(r_{ij}-b_{ij}))]^2,
\eeq
and the corresponding force is:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle {\bf F}_{morse} ({\bf r}_{ij})&=&2 D_{ij} \beta_{ij} r_{ij} exp(-\beta_{ij}(r_{ij}-b_{ij})) * \\
\displaystyle \: & \: &[1 - exp(-\beta_{ij}(r_{ij}-b_{ij}))] \frac{\displaystyle {\bf r}_{ij}}{\displaystyle r_{ij}},
\end{array}
\eeq
where \( \displaystyle D_{ij} \) is the depth of the well in kJ/mole,
\( \displaystyle \beta_{ij} \) defines the steepness of the well (in
nm\(^{-1} \)), and \( \displaystyle b_{ij} \) is the equilibrium
distance in nm.  The steepness parameter \( \displaystyle \beta_{ij}
\) can be expressed in terms of the reduced mass of the atoms {\it i}
and {\it j}, the fundamental vibration frequency \( \displaystyle
\omega_{ij} \) and the well depth \( \displaystyle D_{ij} \):
\beq
\displaystyle \beta_{ij}= \omega_{ij} \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{ij}}{2 D_{ij}}}
\eeq
and because \( \displaystyle \omega = \sqrt{k/\mu} \), one can rewrite \( \displaystyle \beta_{ij} \) in terms of the harmonic force constant \( \displaystyle k_{ij} \)
\beq
\displaystyle \beta_{ij}= \sqrt{\frac{k_{ij}}{2 D_{ij}}}
\eeq
For small deviations \( \displaystyle (r_{ij}-b_{ij}) \), one can expand the \( \displaystyle exp \)-term to first-order in the Taylor expansion: 
\beq
\displaystyle exp(-x) \approx 1-x
\eeq
Substituting this in the functional from;
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle V_{morse} (r_{ij})&=&D_{ij} [1 - exp(-\beta_{ij}(r_{ij}-b_{ij}))]^2\\
\displaystyle \:&=&D_{ij} [1 - (1 -\sqrt{\frac{k_{ij}}{2 D_{ij}}}(r_{ij}-b_{ij}))]^2\\
\displaystyle \:&=&\frac{1}{2} k_{ij} (r_{ij}-b_{ij}))^2,
\end{array}
\eeq
one recovers the harmonic bond stretching potential.

\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_morse.eps,width=7cm}}
\caption {The Morse potential well, with bondlength 0.15 nm}
\label{fig:morse}
\end {figure}

\subsection{Bond angle vibration}
The bond \normindex{angle vibration} between a triplet of atoms $i$ - $j$ - $k$
is also represented by a harmonic potential on the angle $\theta_{ijk}$
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\raisebox{-1.5cm}{\psfig {figure=plots/angle.eps,angle=270,width=5cm}}\psfig {figure=plots/f_angle.eps,angle=270,width=7cm}}
\caption {Principle of the angle vibration (left) and bond angle potential (right).}
\label{fig:angle}
\end {figure}

\beq
V_a(\theta_{ijk}) = \half k^{\theta}_{ijk}(\theta_{ijk}-\theta^0_{ijk})^2
\eeq
As the bond-angle vibration is represented by a harmonic potential the
form is the same as the bond stretching (Figure~\ref{fig:bstretch1}).

The force equations are given by the chain rule:
\beq
\begin{array}{l}
\Fvi	~=~ -\displaystyle\frac{d V_a(\theta_{ijk})}{d \rvi}	\\
\Fvk	~=~ -\displaystyle\frac{d V_a(\theta_{ijk})}{d \rvk}	\\
\Fvj	~=~ -\Fvi-\Fvk
\end{array}
~ \mbox{ ~ where ~ } ~
 \theta_{ijk} = \arccos \frac{(\ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{kj})}{r_{ij}r_{kj}}
\eeq
The numbering $i,j,k$ is in sequence of covalently bonded atoms, with $j$ denoting the middle atom (see figure~\ref{fig:angle}).

\subsection{Improper dihedrals}
Improper Dihedrals are meant to keep \normindex{planar groups} planar (eg. 
aromatic rings) or to prevent molecules from flipping over to their
\normindex{mirror image}s, see Figure~\ref{Fig:imp}.
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=plots/ring-imp.eps,angle=270,width=4cm}\hspace{1cm}
\psfig{figure=plots/subst-im.eps,angle=270,width=3cm}\hspace{1cm}\psfig{figure=plots/tetra-im.eps,angle=270,width=3cm}}
\caption[Improper dihedral types.]{Out of plane bending for rings (left), substituents of rings (middle), out of tetrahedral (right). The improper dihedral angle $\xi$ is defined as the angle between planes (i,j,k) and (j,k,l) in all cases.}
\label{Fig:imp}
\end {figure}
\beq
V_{id}(\xi_{ijkl}) = k_{\xi}(\xi_{ijkl}-\xi_0)^2
\eeq
This is also a harmonic potential, it is plotted in figure~\ref{fig:imps}.
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig{figure=plots/f_imps.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {Improper dihedral potential.}
\label{fig:imps}
\end {figure}

\subsection{Proper dihedrals}
For the normal \normindex{dihedral} interaction there is a choice of either the
GROMOS periodic function or a function based on expansion in powers of
$\cos \phi$ (the so-called Ryckaert-Bellemans potential). This choice
has consequences for the inclusion of special interactions between the
first and the fourth atom of the dihedral quadruple. With the periodic
GROMOS potential a special 1-4 LJ-interaction must be included; with
the Ryckaert-Bellemans potential the \normindex{1-4 interactions} 
must be excluded from the non-bonded list.  

\subsubsection{Proper dihedrals: periodic type}
\normindex{Proper dihedral} angles are defined according to the IUPAC/IUB
convention, where $\phi$ is the angle between the $ijk$ and the $jkl$
planes, with {\bf zero} corresponding to the {\em cis} configuration
($i$ and $l$ on the same side).
\begin {figure}[H]

\caption {Principle of the proper dihedral (left, in {\em trans} form)
and dihedral potential (right).} 
\label{fig:pdihf}
\end {figure}
\beq
V_d(\phi_{ijkl}) = k_{\phi}(1 + cos(n \phi - \phi_0))
\eeq

\subsubsection{Proper dihedrals: Ryckaert-Bellemans function}
For alkanes, the following proper dihedral potential is often used
(see fig~\ref{fig:rbdih})
\beq
V_{rb}(\phi_{ijkl}) = \sum_{n=0}^5 C_n( \cos(\psi ))^n,
\eeq 
where $\psi = \phi - 180^0$.  \\
{\bf Note:} A conversion from one convention to another can be achieved by 
multiplying every coefficient \( \displaystyle C_n \) 
by \( \displaystyle (-1)^n \).

The following constants for $C$ are given below:
\begin{table}[H]
\caption{Constants for Ryckaert-Bellemans potential (kJ mole$^{-1}$)}

$C_3$	&	-3.06	&	$C_4$	&26.24	&	$C_5$	&-31.5	\\

\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_rbs.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {Ryckaert-Bellemans dihedral potential}
\label{fig:rbdih}
\end {figure}
({\bf Note:} The use of this potential implies exclusions of LJ-interactions
between the first and the last atom of the dihedral, and $\psi$ is defined
according to the 'polymer convention' ($\psi_{trans}=0$).)

The RB dihedral function can also be used to include the \normindex{OPLS} 
dihedral potential~\cite{Jorgensen88}. 
The OPLS potential function is given as the first 
four terms of a fourier series:
\beq
V_{rb} (\phi_{ijkl}) ~=~ V_0 + \frac{1}{2} (V_1(1+\cos(\psi)) + V_2(
1-\cos(2\psi)) + V_3(1+\cos(3\psi))),
\eeq
with \( \displaystyle \psi=\phi \) (protein convention).
Because of the equalities \( \cos(2\phi) = 2(\cos(\phi))^2 - 1 \) 
and \( \cos(3\phi) = 4(\cos(\phi))^3 - 3\cos(\phi) \), 
one can translate the OPLS parameters to 
Ryckaert-Bellemans parameters as follows:
\beq
\displaystyle
\begin{array}{rcl}
\displaystyle C_0&=&V_0 + V_2 + \frac{1}{2} (V_1 + V_3)\\
\displaystyle C_1&=&\frac{1}{2} (3V_3 - V_1)\\
\displaystyle C_2&=&-V_2\\
\displaystyle C_3&=&-2V_3\\
\displaystyle C_4&=&0\\
\displaystyle C_5&=&0
\end{array}
\eeq
with OPLS parameters in protein convention and RB parameters in 
polymer convention.\\
\noindent{\bf Note:} Mind the conversion from {\em kcal mole$^{-1}$} for 
OPLS and RB parameters in literature to {\em kJ mole$^{-1}$} in GROMACS.

\subsection{Special interactions}
Special potentials are used for imposing restraints on the motion of
the system, either to avoid disastrous deviations, or to include
knowledge from experimental data. In either case they are not really
part of the force field and the reliability of the parameters is not
important. The potential forms, as implemented in {\gromacs}, are
mentioned just for the sake of completeness.

\subsection{Position restraints}
\label{sec:posre}
These are used to restrain particles to fixed reference positions
$\ve{R}_i$. They can be used during equilibration in order to avoid
too drastic rearrangemenst of critical parts (e.g. to restrain motion
in a protein that is subjected to large solvent forces when the
solvent is not yet equilibrated). Another application is the
restraining of particles in a shell around a region that is simulated
in detail, while the shell is only approximated because it lacks
proper interaction from missing particles outside the
shell. Restraining will then maintain the integrity of the inner
part. For spherical shells it is a wise procedure to make the force
constant depend on the radius, increasing from zero at the inner
boundary to a large value at the outer boundary. This application has
not been implemented in {\gromacs} however.
\newcommand{\unitv}[1]{\hat{\bf #1}}
\newcommand{\halfje}[1]{\frac{#1}{2}}

The following form is used: 
\beq
V_{pr}(\ve{r}_i) = \halfje{1}k_{pr}|\rvi-\ve{R}_i|^2
\eeq
The potential is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:posres}.
\begin {figure}[H]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_pr.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {Position restraint potential}
\label{fig:posres}
\end {figure}
The potential form can be rewritten without loss of generality as:
\beq
V_{pr}(\ve{r}_i) = \halfje{1} \left[ k_{pr}^x (x_i-X_i)^2 ~\unitv{x} + k_{pr}^y (y_i-Y_i)^2 ~\unitv{y} + k_{pr}^z (z_i-Z_i)^2 ~\unitv{z}\right]
\eeq

Now the forces are:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
F_i^x &=& -k_{pr}^x~(x_i - X_i)	\\
F_i^y &=& -k_{pr}^y~(y_i - Y_i)	\\
F_i^z &=& -k_{pr}^z~(z_i - Z_i)
\end{array}
\eeq
Using three different force constants the position 
restraints can be turned on or off
in each spatial dimension; this means that atoms can be harmonically
restrained to a plane or a line.
\normindex{Position restraints} 
are applied to a special fixed list of atoms. Such a
list can be generated using the {\tt genpr} utility.

\subsection{Distance restraints}
\label{sec:disre}
\normindex{Distance restraints} 
add a penalty to the potential when the distance
between specified pairs of atoms exceeds a threshold value. They are
normally used to impose experimental restraints, as from \normindex{NOE}
experiments in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), on the motion of the
system. Thus MD can be used for \normindex{structure refinement}  using 
\normindex{NMR} data. The
potential form is quadratic between two specified distances and linear
beyond the largest distance (see figure~\ref{fig:dist}).
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
V_{dr}(r_{ij})~=~&~0 \hspace{4cm}                  & r_{ij} < r_0         \\
	\:     =~&~\half k_{dr}(r_{ij}-r_0)^2	   & r_0 \le r_{ij} < r_1 \\
	\:     =~&~\half k_{dr}(r_1-r_0)(2r_{ij}-r_1-r_0) & r_{ij} \ge r_1
\label{eqn:disre}
\end{array}
\eeq
\begin {figure}[H]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/f_dr.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption {Distance Restraint potential}
\label{fig:dist}
\end {figure}
The forces are
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ve{F}_i~=~&~0 \hspace{4cm}  & r_{ij} < r_0         \\
 \: = ~&-~k_{dr}(r_{ij}-r_0)\frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} & r_0 \le r_{ij} < r_1\\
 \: = ~&-~k_{dr}(r_1-r_0)\frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}    & r_{ij} \ge r_1	
\end{array}
\eeq
The above formulae have been improved by introducing the
{\em time averaged} distance restraint~\cite{Torda89} where the distance
$r_{ij}$ is replaced by a time average:
\beq
\bar{r}_{ij} = < r_{ij}^{-3} >^{-1/3}
\label{eqn:rav}
\eeq
This way an atom can satisfy two incompatible distance restraints 
{\em on average} by moving between two protons. 
An example would be an amino-acid sidechain which is rotating around
its $\chi$ dihedral angle, thereby coming close to various other groups.
Such a mobile side chain may give rise to multiple NOEs. The use of
time averaged restraints allows the sidechain to fulfill all
experimental restraints.

The computation of the time
averaged distance in the {\tt mdrun} program is done in the following fashion:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\bar{r}_{ij}(0)^{-3} 	&=& r_{ij}(0)^{-3}	\\
\bar{r}_{ij}(t)^{-3}	&=& \bar{r}_{ij}(t-\Delta t)^{-3}~\exp{\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}\right)} + r_{ij}(t)^{-3}\left[1-\exp{\left(-\frac{\Delta t}{\tau}\right)}\right]
\label{eqn:ravdisre}
\end{array}
\eeq
Sometimes it is unclear from experimental data which atom pair
gives rise to a single NOE, in other occasions it can be assumed that
more than one pair contributes due to the symmetry of the system, e.g. a
methyl group with three protons. For such a group it is not possible 
to distinguish between the protons, therefore they should all be taken into
account when calculating the distance between this methyl group and another
proton (or group of protons).
Due to the physical nature of magnetic resonance, the intensity of the
NOE signal is proportional to the distance between atoms to the power of -6.
Thus, when combining atom pairs, 
a fixed list of $N$ restraints may be taken together, 
where the net ``distance'' is given by:
\beq
r_{N}(t) = \left [\sum_{n=1}^{N} \bar{r}_{n}(t)^{-6} \right]^{-1/6}
\label{eqn:rsix}
\eeq
where we use eqn.\ref{eqn:rav} for the $\bar{r}_{n}$.

As more pairs of protons contribute to the same NOE signal, the intensity
will increase, and the summed ``distance'' will be shorter than any of
its components due to the reciprocal summation. 
It is also possible to use {\em ensemble averaging} using multiple
(protein)  molecules. In this case the bounds should be lowered as in:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
r_0	&~=~&	r_0 * M^{-1/6}	\\
r_1	&~=~&	r_1 * M^{-1/6}
\end{array}
\eeq
where $M$ is the number of molecules. The {\gromacs} preprocessor {\tt grompp}
can do this automatically when the appropriate option is given.
The resulting ``distance'' is 
then used to calculate the scalar force according to:
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
\ve{F}_i~=~&~0 \hspace{4cm}  & r_{N} < r_0         \\
  = ~&-~ k_{dr}(r_{N}-r_0)\frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}} & r_0 \le r_{N} < r_1 \\
  = ~&-~ k_{dr}(r_1-r_0)\frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{r_{ij}}    & r_{N} \ge r_1	
\end{array}
\eeq
where $i$ and $j$ denote the atoms  of all the 
pairs that contribute to the NOE signal.

\section{Free energy calculations}
\label{sec:fep}
\newcommand{\LAM}{\mu}
\newcommand{\LL}{(1-\mu)}
\newcommand{\dvdl}[1]{\frac{\partial #1}{\partial \LAM}}
Free energy perturbation calculations can be performed in {\gromacs} using
either the ``slow-growth'' method, or using umbrella sampling.
This requires modification of the hamiltonian $H$, which can be derived
using the partition function $Z$.
If we write the Gibbs free energy $G$ using $Z$:
\bea
Z	&=&	\int \int \exp\left(-\beta H(p,q))\right) {\rm d}p {\rm d}q \\
G	&=&	-k_B T \ln Z
\eea
where $\beta$=$1/(k_B T)$ with $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant 
and $T$ the temperature.
$p$ are the generalized momenta and $q$ are the generalized coordinates.
We can split the Hamiltonian in the potential $V$ and kinetic $K$ parts:
\bea
H	&=&	V(q)	+ 	K(p)		\\
K(p)	&=&	\sum_i^N \frac{p_i^2}{2 m_i}	
\eea
where $N$ is the number of particles in the system and $m_i$ are the masses
of the particles.
\beq
\begin{array}{rcl}
G	&~=~&	-1/\beta \ln \left[\int \exp(-\beta V(q)) dq \int \exp(-\beta K(p)) dp  \right] \\
\mbox{or} \\
G	&~=~&	\left< K(p) \right>	-1/\beta \ln 
\end{array}
\eeq

Here are the modified equations used to calculate the free energy


\subsubsection{Harmonic potentials}
The example given here is for the bond potential which is harmonic
in {\gromacs}. However,  these equations apply to the angle potential
and the improper dihedral potential as well.
\bea
V_b		&=&\half(\LL k_b^A + \LAM k_b^B) (b - \LL b_0^A - \LAM b_0^B)^2	\\
\dvdl{V_b}	&=&\half(k_b^B-k_b^A)\cdot\nonumber \\
		&&\left[b - \LL b_0^A + \LAM b_0^B)^2 + (b_0^A-b_0^B) (b - \LL b_0^A -\LAM b_0^B)\right]
\eea

\subsubsection{Proper dihedrals}
For the proper dihedrals, the equations are somewhat more complicated:
\bea
V_d	&=&(\LL k_d^A + \LAM k_d^B) ( 1+ \cos(n_{\phi} \phi - (\LL \phi_0^A + \LAM \phi_0^B))	\\
\dvdl{V_d}&=&(k_d^B-k_d^A) \nonumber\\
	&& \biggl[ 1+ \cos(n_{\phi} \phi- [\LL \phi_0^A + \LAM \phi_0^B])-\nonumber\\
	&&(\LL k_d^A + \LAM k_d^B) (\phi_0^A - \phi_0^B) 
	\sin(n_{\phi}\phi - [\LL \phi_0^A + \LAM \phi_0^B]\biggr]
\eea
{\bf Note:} that the multiplicity $n_{\phi}$ can not be parametrized
because the function should remain periodic on the interval $0..2\pi$.

\subsubsection{Coulomb interaction}
The \normindex{Coulomb} interaction between two particles 
of which the charge varies with $\LAM$ is:
\bea
V_c &=& \frac{f}{\epsrf \rij}\left[(\LL q_i^A+\LAM q_i^B)\cdot(\LL q_j^A+\LAM q_i^B)\right]	\\
\dvdl{V_c}&=& \frac{f}{\epsrf \rij}\left[(q_j^B-q_j^A)(\LL q_i^A+\LAM q_i^B)\,+\,
			(q_i^B-q_i^A)(\LL q_j^A+\LAM q_j^B)\right]
\eea
where $f = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} = 138.935\,485$ (see Chapter~\ref{ch:defunits})

\subsubsection{Coulomb interaction with Reaction Field}
The coulomb interaction including a reaction field, between two particles 
of which the charge varies with $\LAM$ is:
\bea
V_c 	&=& f\left[\frac{1}{\rij} + k_{rf}~ \rij^2 -c_{rf}\right]\nonumber\\
	&~& \left[(\LL q_i^A+\LAM q_i^B)\cdot(\LL q_j^A+\LAM q_i^B)\right]	\\
\dvdl{V_c}&=& f\left[\frac{1}{\rij} + k_{rf}~ \rij^2 -c_{rf}\right]\nonumber\\
	&~&\left[(q_j^B-q_j^A)(\LL q_i^A+\LAM q_i^B)\,+\,
			(q_i^B-q_i^A)(\LL q_j^A+\LAM q_j^B)\right]
\eea
{\bf Note} that the constants $k_{rf}$ and $c_{rf}$ are 
defined using the dielectric 
constant $\epsrf$ of the medium (see section~\ref{sec:coulrf}).

\subsubsection{Lennard-Jones interaction}
{\undercons}
For the \normindex{Lennard Jones} interaction between two particles 
of which the {\em atomtype} varies with $\LAM$ we can write:
\bea
V_{LJ} 	&=&	\frac{(\LL C_{12}^A + \LAM C_{12}^B)}{\rij^{12}} -
		\frac{\LL C_6^A + \LAM C_6^B}{\rij^6}	\\
\dvdl{V_{LJ}}&=&\frac{C_{12}^B - C_{12}^A}{\rij^{12}} -
		\frac{C_6^B - C_6^A}{\rij^6}
\eea
It should be noted that it is also possible to express a pathway from
state $A$ to state $B$ using $\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ (see \eqnref{sigeps}).
It may seem to make sense  physically, to vary the forcefield parameters
$\sigma$ and $\epsilon$ rather 
than the derived parameters $C_{12}$ and $C_{6}$.
However, the difference between the pathways in parameter space
is not large, and the free energy itself
does not depend on the pathway, therefore we use the simple formulation
presented above.

\subsubsection{Kinetic Energy}
{\undercons}
When the mass of a particle changes there is also a contribution of
the kinetic energy to the free energy:
\bea
Ek	&=&	\half\frac{\ve{p}^2}{\LL m^A + \LAM m^B}	\\
\dvdl{Ek}&=&	-\half\frac{\ve{p}^2(m^B-m^A)}{(\LL m^A + \LAM m^B)^2}
\eea
Note that we can not write the momentum \ve{p} as m\ve{v} since that would result 
in the sign of $\dvdl{Ek}$ being incorrect~\cite{Gunsteren98a}.

\subsubsection{Contsraints}
\newcommand{\clam}{C_{\lambda}}
The constraints are formally part of the hamiltonian, and therefore
they give a contribution to the free energy. In {\gromacs} this can be
calculated using the \normindex{LINCS} algorithm only.
If we have a number of contsraint equations $g_k$:
\beq
g_k	=	r_{k} - d_{k}
\eeq
where $\ve{r}_k$ is the distance vector between two particles and 
$d_k$ is the contsraint distance between the two particles we can write
this using a $\LAM$ dependent distance as
\beq
g_k 	=	r_{k} - \left(\LL d_{k}^A + \LAM d_k^B\right)
\eeq
the contribution $\clam$ 
to the hamiltonian using Lagrange multipliers $\lambda$:
\bea
\clam		&=&	\sum_k \lambda_k g_k	\\
\dvdl{\clam}	&=&	\sum_k \lambda_k \left(d_k^B-d_k^A\right)
\eea


\section{Methods}
\subsection{Exclusions and 1-4 Interactions.}
Atoms within a molecule that are close by in the chain, 
i.e. atoms that are covalently bonded, or linked by one respectively two
atoms are so-called {\em first neighbours, second neighbours} and 
{\em \normindex{third neighbours}}, (see Figure~\ref{fig:chain}). Since the
interactions of atom {\bf i} with {\bf i+1} 
\begin {figure}[ht]
\centerline{\psfig {figure=plots/chain.eps,angle=270,width=8cm}}
\caption{Atoms along an alkane chain}
\label{fig:chain}
\end {figure}
and the interaction of atom {\bf i} with atom {\bf i+2} are mainly
quantum mechanical, they can not be modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential.
Instead it is assumed that these interactions are adequately modeled
by a harmonic bond term or constraint ({\bf i,i+1}) and a harmonic angle term
({\bf i,i+2}). The first and second neighbours (atoms {\bf i+1}and {\bf i+2}) 
are therefore
{\em excluded} from the Lennard-Jones \normindex{interaction list} 
of atom {\bf i};
atoms {\bf i+1} and {\bf i+2} are called {\em \normindex{exclusions}} of atom {\bf i}.

For third neighbours the normal Lennard-Jones repulsion is sometimes
still too strong, which means that when applied to a molecule the
molecule would deform or break due to the internal strain. This is
especially the case for Carbon-Carbon interactions in a {\em
cis}-conformation (eg. {\em cis}-butane).  Therefore for some of these
interactions the Lennard-Jones repulsion has been reduced in the
Gromos force field, which is implemented by keeping a separate list of
1-4 and normal Lennard-Jones parameters. In other force fields, such
as OPLS~\cite{Jorgensen88}, the standard Lennard-Jones parameters are reduced
by a factor of two, but in that case also the dispersion (r$^{-6}$)
and the coulomb interaction are scaled.
{\gromacs} can use either of these methods.

\subsection{Cut-Offs and Charge Groups.}
In principle the force calculation in MD is an $O(N^2)$ problem. 
Therefore we apply a \normindex{cut-off} 
for nonbonded force (NBF) calculations:
only the particles within a certain distance of each other
are interacting. This reduces the cost to $O(N)$ (typically
$100N$ to $200N$) of the NBF. It also introduces an error,
which is, in most cases, acceptable, except when applying the cut-off
implies the creation of charges.

Consider a water molecule interacting with another atom. When we would apply
the cut-off on an atom-atom basis we might include the atom-Oxygen
interaction (with a charge of -0.82) without the compensating charge
of the Hydrogens and so induce a large dipole moment over the system.
Therefore we have to keep groups of atoms with total charge
0 together, the so-called {\em charge groups}.

\section{Dummy atoms.}
\label{sec:dummy}
Dummy atoms can be used in {\gromacs} in a number of ways. 
We write the position of the dummy particle \ve{r} as a function of
the positions of other particles \ve{r}$_i$:
$\ve{r}	=	f(\ve{r}_1..\ve{r}_n)$. The dummy, which may carry
charge, or can be involved in other interactions can now be used
in the force calculation. 
The force acting on the dummy particle must be redistributed over the atoms
in a consistent way. A good way to do this 
can be found in ref.~\cite{Berendsen84b}.
We can write the potential energy as
\beq
V = V(\ve{r},\ve{r}_1..\ve{r}_n) = V^*(\ve{r}_1..\ve{r}_n)
\eeq
The force on the particle $i$ is then
\beq
\ve{F}_i = -\frac{\partial V^*}{\partial \ve{r}_i} = -\frac{\partial V}{\partial \ve{r}_i} - \frac{\partial V}{\partial \ve{r}}\frac{\partial \ve{r}}{\partial \ve{r}_i} = \ve{F}_i^{direct} + \ve{F}_i^{distr}
\eeq
the first term of which is the normal force. 
The second term is the force on particle $i$ due to the dummy particle, which
can be conveniently rewritten in tensor notation:
\newcommand{\mymac}[2]{\displaystyle\frac{\partial #1}{\partial #2_i}}
\beq
\ve{F}_i^{distr} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
\mymac{x}{x} & \mymac{y}{x} & \mymac{z}{x}	\\[4mm]
\mymac{x}{y} & \mymac{y}{y} & \mymac{z}{y}	\\[4mm]
\mymac{x}{z} & \mymac{y}{z} & \mymac{z}{z}
\end{array}\right]\ve{F}
\eeq
where \ve{F} is the force on the dummy particle. In this way the total
force and the total torque are conserved~\cite{Berendsen84b}.

There are three ways to construct dummies from surrounding atoms in
{\gromacs}. Notethat all possible dummies could be constructed from
types 2$''$ (normalized, in-plane) and 3 (non-normalized, out of
plane). However, the amount of computation involved increases sharply
along this list, so it is strongly recommended to always use the first
dummy type that will be sufficient.

\begin{itemize}
\item[1.]As a linear combination of two atoms:
\beq
	\ve{r} ~=~ \ve{r}_i + a \ve{r}_{ij}
\eeq
	in this case the dummy is on the line through atoms $i$ and
	$j$. The force on particles $i$ and $j$ due to the force on
	the dummy can be computed as:
\beq
	\begin{array}{l}
	\ve{F}_i ~=~	(1-a)\ve{F}	\\
	\ve{F}_j ~=~	a\ve{F}		\\
	\end{array}
\eeq

\item[2.]As a linear combination of three atoms:
\beq
	\ve{r} ~=~ \ve{r}_i + a \ve{r}_{ij} + b \ve{r}_{ik}
\eeq
	in this case the dummy is always in the plane of the other three
	particles.
	The force on particles $i$, $j$ and $k$ due to the force on the dummy
	can be computed as:
\beq
	\begin{array}{l}
	\ve{F}_i ~=~	(1-a-b)\ve{F}	\\
	\ve{F}_j ~=~	a\ve{F} 	\\
	\ve{F}_k ~=~	b\ve{F} 	\\
	\end{array}
\eeq

\item[2$'$.]In the plane of three atoms, with a fixed distance:
\beq
	\ve{r} ~=~ \ve{r}_i + b \frac{  \ve{r}_{ij} + a \ve{r}_{jk}  }
				     {| \ve{r}_{ij} + a \ve{r}_{jk} |}	
\eeq
	in this case the dummy is in the plane of the other three
	particles at a distance of $b$ from $i$.
	The force on particles $i$, $j$ and $k$ due to the force on the dummy
	can be computed as:
\beq
	\begin{array}{l}
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_i ~=~	(1-(1+a)\frac{b}{\ell}) \ve{F}		\\
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_j ~=~	\frac{b}{\ell} \ve{F}	\\ 
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_k ~=~	a \frac{b}{\ell} \ve{F} 		\\
	\end{array}
	~\mbox{~ where~ }~
	\ell = | \ve{r}_{ij} + a \ve{r}_{jk} |
\eeq

\item[2$''$.]In the plane of three atoms, with a fixed angle and distance:
\beq
	 \ve{r} ~=~ \ve{r}_i +
	 	    d \cos \theta \frac{\ve{r}_{ij}}{|\ve{r}_{ij}|} +
		    d \sin \theta \frac{\ve{r}_\perp}{|\ve{r}_\perp|}
	~\mbox{~ where~ }~
	\ve{r}_\perp ~=~ \ve{r}_{jk} - 
			\frac{ \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{jk} }
			     { \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{ij} }
			 \ve{r}_{ij}
\eeq
	in this case the dummy is in the plane of the other three
	particles at a distance of $d$ from $i$ at an angle of
	$\theta$ with $\ve{r}_{ij}$. Note that in this case $d$ and
	$\theta$ must be specified in stead of $a$ and $b$ (see also
	~\secref{dummytop}). The force on particles $i$, $j$ and $k$
	due to the force on the dummy can be computed as:
\beq
	\begin{array}{l}
\vspace{4mm}
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_i ~=~ \left( 1 -
			\frac{d \cos \theta}{|\ve{r}_{ij}|} +
			\frac{d \sin \theta}{|\ve{r}_\perp|}
			\frac{ \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{jk} }
			     { \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{ij} } 
			     \right) \ve{F}	\\
\vspace{4mm}
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_j ~=~ \left(
				\frac{d \cos \theta}{|\ve{r}_{ij}|} -
			\left( 1 + \frac{ \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{jk} }
				        { \ve{r}_{ij} \cdot \ve{r}_{ij} }
			\right)
			\frac{d \sin \theta}{|\ve{r}_\perp|} 
			     \right) \ve{F}	\\
\displaystyle	\ve{F}_k ~=~ \frac{d \sin \theta}{|\ve{r}_\perp|} \ve{F}\\
	\end{array}
\eeq

\item[3.]As a non-linear combination of three atoms, out of plane:
\beq
	\ve{r} ~=~ \ve{r}_i + a \ve{r}_{ij} + b \ve{r}_{ik} +
		c (\ve{r}_{ij} \times \ve{r}_{ik})
\eeq
	this enables the construction of dummies out of the plane of the
	other atoms.
	The force on particles $i,j$ and $k$ due to the force on the dummy
	can be computed as:
\beq
\begin{array}{l}
\vspace{4mm}
\ve{F}_j^{distr} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
 a 		&  -c\,z_{ik}	& c\,y_{ik}	\\[2mm]
 c\,z_{ik} 	&   a 		& -c\,x_{ik}	\\[2mm]
-c\,y_{ik} 	&   c\,x_{ik} 	& a
\end{array}\right]\ve{F}					\\
\vspace{4mm}
\ve{F}_k^{distr} = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
 b 		&   c\,z_{ij}	& -c\,y_{ij}	\\[2mm]
-c\,z_{ij} 	&   b 		& c\,x_{ij}	\\[2mm]
 c\,y_{ij} 	&  -c\,x_{ij} 	& b
\end{array}\right]\ve{F}					\\
\ve{F}_i^{distr} = \ve{F} - \ve{F}_j^{distr} - \ve{F}_k^{distr}
\end{array}
\eeq

\end{itemize}


\section{Future Improvements.}
{\undercons}
In future versions of the force field there will be
\begin{itemize}
\item  	Inclusion of long-range electrostatic interactions.
\item	A choice of force fields, including either Gromos, OPLS or
        MM2/MM3 parameters. 
\item	The ultimate force field including polarisability. If done
        well, this may simplify many other terms in the force field. 
\end{itemize}
